# Introducing Velda: Cloud Development That Actually Feels Local

**Simplify cloud development with instant access to GPU clusters, AI training resources, and high-performance computing - without the complexity of containers or Kubernetes.**

## The Cloud Development Problem: Complexity vs. Cost

**AI developers and teams running compute-intensive workloads face a painful dilemma:** either deal with the complexity of containers, clusters, and resource tuning, or pay thousands monthly for always-on powerful instances that sit idle during development. 

**Need GPU power for AI training?** You need 8 H100s for a few hours. **Processing massive datasets?** Maybe 64 CPU cores. **Building and testing applications?** High-memory instances. But current cloud solutions force you to choose between:

‚Ä¢ **Expensive idle time**: Provision powerful instances that waste money during development downtime  
‚Ä¢ **Kubernetes complexity**: Navigate container orchestration just to run a simple test, script, or service  
‚Ä¢ **Resource queues**: Wait in long queues on shared computing clusters  
‚Ä¢ **Container overhead**: Deal with registry management and dependency mismatches  

Whether you're **training neural networks**, **processing massive datasets**, or **running distributed builds**, there has to be a better way.

## Velda's Vision: Cloud Computing That Feels Local

**We believe running compute workloads in the cloud should be as simple as running them locally.** 

Imagine having **instant access to any compute configuration** ‚Äî from GPU clusters for AI training to high-CPU instances for data processing to massive memory for analytics ‚Äî but **only paying for the exact compute time you use**. 

**No cluster management. No container overhead. No idle costs.**

## How Velda Simplifies Cloud Development

**One command prefix changes everything.** When developing AI models, processing data, or running any compute-intensive application on Velda, simplicity is key. The `vrun` command is all you need to scale from your dev environment to any compute configuration:

```bash
# AI model training with 8 H100 GPUs
vrun -P gpu-h100-8 python train_llm.py

# Large-scale data processing with 64 CPUs  
vrun -P cpu-64 python process_dataset.py

# GPU-accelerated fine-tuning with A100s
vrun -P gpu-a100-2 python fine_tune.py

# Parallel builds with 32 CPU cores
vrun -P cpu-32 make -j32 build_project
```

**Behind the scenes, Velda automatically:**

‚Ä¢ **Allocates resources instantly**: GPUs, CPUs, and memory on-demand  
‚Ä¢ **Shares your environment**: Libraries, dependencies, datasets, and configs travel with your code  
‚Ä¢ **Streams real-time output**: Logs and results appear as if running locally  
‚Ä¢ **Auto-shutdown**: Expensive resources terminate automatically when processes complete  

**You'll hardly notice your workload is running on different compute instances.** No Docker images, Kubernetes manifests, or resource tuning required.

## How Velda Compares to Existing Solutions

## Velda vs. Kubernetes: Simplicity Without Sacrifice

**While Kubernetes offers powerful orchestration, it comes with significant complexity overhead:**

**Kubernetes challenges:**
‚Ä¢ Complex cluster setup and management requirements  
‚Ä¢ Container dependency conflicts and version mismatches  
‚Ä¢ Registry cleanup and image management overhead  
‚Ä¢ High latency from build/push/pull cycles  
‚Ä¢ Auto-scaling configuration complexity  

**Velda's advantage:**
‚Ä¢ **Zero setup per workload** ‚Äî just use `vrun`  
‚Ä¢ **No container issues** ‚Äî your environment travels with your code  
‚Ä¢ **Instant execution** ‚Äî no image build/push/pull cycles  
‚Ä¢ **Smart resource allocation** ‚Äî minimal scheduling overhead  
‚Ä¢ **Built-in auto-scaling** ‚Äî no complex configuration needed  

## Velda vs. Slurm: Cloud-Native by Design

**Traditional HPC schedulers like Slurm work well for research clusters but fall short in modern cloud environments:**

**Slurm limitations:**
‚Ä¢ **Batch-only focus**: Primarily designed for batch jobs with limited service support  
‚Ä¢ **No load balancing**: Lacks native load balancing capabilities  
‚Ä¢ **Manual scaling**: Static resource allocation requiring manual intervention  
‚Ä¢ **Single-cluster limitation**: Typically tied to single on-premises clusters  
‚Ä¢ **Shared environments**: No isolation between users  

**Velda's cloud-native approach:**
‚Ä¢ **Full service support**: Services and load balancers included  
‚Ä¢ **Auto-scaling architecture**: Cloud-native with automatic scaling  
‚Ä¢ **Multi-cloud compatibility**: Works seamlessly across cloud providers  
‚Ä¢ **Kubernetes integration**: Can leverage existing Kubernetes backends  
‚Ä¢ **Isolated environments**: Customizable for every developer
