# Transform How Your Team Builds Software with Velda

Imagine developing at the speed of thought, without infrastructure limitations. Velda bridges your local environment to limitless cloud power—enabling teams to innovate faster, cut costs dramatically, and eliminate DevOps frustrations.

## Instant Scaling When You Need It
Transform any command into a cloud-powered operation with a simple prefix. Need GPU acceleration for that ML workload? Require 64 cores for compilation? Just type `vrun` and access any cloud resource—premium GPUs or multi-CPU machines—instantly. Scale up for intensive tasks, then scale down when finished. Pay only for what you use, when you use it.

## End Environment Headaches Forever
Continue using your favorite package managers and tools (pip, apt, npm, conda, uv) exactly as you do today. Every Velda-managed workload runs in its own consistent, isolated environment—eliminating "works on my machine" issues once and for all.

Unlike traditional HPC solutions where one change affects everyone, Velda provides complete isolation. Team members can customize their environments freely without fear of breaking others' workflows. Onboard new developers in minutes using environment templates—not days or weeks.

## Freedom to Build Your Way
Use any framework, library, or tool without restrictions. If it runs in a container, it runs on Velda. Deploy on your preferred infrastructure—AWS, Google Cloud, on-premises—or choose Velda-hosted for a zero-maintenance experience. Velda adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.

## Security That Meets Enterprise Standards
Keep your data and code protected with Velda's enterprise-grade security. We integrate seamlessly with your existing security infrastructure through SSO, SAML, and secure, air-tight deployment in your VPC.
